# FdF - Fil de Fer (Wireframe)

First 42 school graphic project.

Creation of a simplified graphic “wireframe” representation of a relief landscape.

The aim of the project was to discover the basics of graphic programming, and in particular how to:
* place points in space
* join them with segments
* observe the scene from a particular viewpoint
* discover a first graphic library: miniLibX

## Usages
